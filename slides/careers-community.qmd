# What next for community and careers in bioimage analysis?

## Introductory context

## Big imaging data {.smaller}

e.g. the IARPA MICrONS dataset

## Big imaging data {.smaller}

> This IARPA MICrONS dataset spans a 1.4mm x .87mm x .84 mm volume of cortex in a P87 mouse. The dataset was imaged using two-photon microscopy, microCT, and serial electron microscopy, and then reconstructed using a combination of AI and human proofreading.

Gaining insight from large imaging data requires diverse technical expertise
Collaboration and technical skills are essential!

## Postdoc careers {.smaller}

> Madeline Lancaster, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK, can relate to that. In July, she received a total of 36 applications for a postdoctoral position in her laboratory, many fewer than the couple of hundred that she originally expected. ‚ÄúI had been nervous that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go through all of the applications,‚Äù she says. Those 36 didn‚Äôt lead to a single appointment. ‚ÄúI still have not filled the position,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere seems to be lots of competition for strong candidates.‚Äù

## Postdoc careers {.smaller}
> Those who stayed and landed a coveted faculty position were more likely to have had a highly cited paper, changed their research topic between their PhD and postdoc, or moved abroad after receiving their doctorate.
