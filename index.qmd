## Wider context in current bioimaging

Data is getting larger

Data is not standardised

Community efforts to collaborate

  * `bioformats`
  * more recently, `OME-zarr`

More on community in the afternoon

## TIFF

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* Current _de facto_ standard (aside from proprietary)
  * Large stacks: folders of 2D tiffs
* Not designed for scientific applications
* `bioformats` can help convert from proprietary
:::
::: {.column}
![](img/2d-stack.png)
::: 
::::

## Limitations

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
1. Data does not fit into memory.
2. Would be nice to compress data, 
   * But need to uncompress whole files to read a few pixels.
   * Uncompressing can be slow
:::
::: {.column}
![](img/2d-stack.png){height=450}

::: aside
Conversion via `bioformats` also can be slow

## Solution (spoiler!)

OME-zarr

* community support[^1]
* uses "chunked storage"
* uses "pyramidal file format"

* Save each chunk into a separate file

::: {.column}
![](img/2d-stack-access.png){height=400}
:::
::: {.column}
![](img/chunk-access.png){height=400}

::::

* Allows reading and decompressing fewer pixels

## Chunked storage

`zarr`

## Lots of choices

* where should we store the data?
  * on the cloud or locally?
* how big should we make the chunks?
* how should we compress each chunk?

Luckily, Ruaridh and Kimberly can help!

## Benchmarking zarr{.smaller}

TODO: explain benchmarking setup: what image? how big was the image? how was benchmarking performed?

## Benchmarking zarr{.smaller}

![](img/benchmarks-1.png)

Choice of compression library affects read time more than compression level.

## Benchmarking zarr{.smaller}

![](img/benchmarks-2.png)

Choice of compression library affects write time more than compression level.

## Benchmarking zarr

TODO: split image into 3, and put in separate columns

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
Tensorstore is a lot faster at reading data than zarr-python.

## Benchmarking zarr

![](img/benchmarks-4.png){height=450}

Larger chunk sizes reduce reading time (but will increase memory usage!)

## Benchmarking zarr conclusions {.smaller}

Approximately "optimal" choices

* Use `tensorstore` library to read data
* Split it into chunks of 100,100,100
* Compress it with `blosc-zstd` at level `12`

::: aside
This could be different for different data!

## Pyramidal file formats

Chunks help with reading subsets of pixels, but what it you want to view the image as whole?

## Pyramidal file formats

![](img/multiscale.png){height=450}

Idea: multiscale images!

## Pyramidal file formats

![](img/multiscale.png){height=450}

Even better idea: multiscale images that follow a standard.

## OME-zarr

TODO: expand
A metadata standard for biological images 

## Further topics {.smaller}

* tools are in flux
  * `zarr` v2 versus v3 
  * which tools are compatible with which?!
* [sharding](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/performance.html#sharding)
  * filesystems don't like many small files!

## Plan

* handling OME zarr data with Python
* get your hands dirty
  * gain an intuition

## Default adventure

* convert a tiff stack to OME zarr
* apply a threshold to it, chunk by chunk

## Self-paced learning

* encouraged to create your own adventure
  * work on your own data
  * some time to report back
* encouraged to get involved with others
  * lots of diverse expertise in the room

## Some tips
* bioio + reader plugins
* run on small data first
* ask for help

## A warning
Run on small data first

## Default data

## Inspecting your image

## Converting your image to OME-zarr

## the mouse checkerboard challenge
agnostic segmentation into cortical and trabecular bone chunk wise

## ideas

* different chunksizes gives diff
* benchmarks
* apply to own data
* hard: more difficult segmentation
  * apply a gaussian filter

# What next for community and careers in bioimage analysis?

## Introductory context

* setting the scene from my perspective
* please disagree

## Big imaging data {.smaller}

![](img/microns-dataset){width=700 fig-align=center}

e.g. the IARPA MICrONS dataset

## Big imaging data {.smaller}

> This IARPA MICrONS dataset spans a 1.4mm x .87mm x .84 mm volume of cortex in a P87 mouse. The dataset was imaged using two-photon microscopy, microCT, and serial electron microscopy, and then reconstructed using a combination of AI and human proofreading.

* Gaining insight from large imaging data requires diverse technical expertise
* Collaboration and technical skills are essential!

## Postdoc careers {.smaller}

![](img/paucity-of-postdocs.png){width=700 fig-align=center}

> Madeline Lancaster, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK, can relate to that. In July, she received a total of 36 applications for a postdoctoral position in her laboratory, many fewer than the couple of hundred that she originally expected. “I had been nervous that I wouldn’t be able to go through all of the applications,” she says. Those 36 didn’t lead to a single appointment. “I still have not filled the position,” she says. “There seems to be lots of competition for strong candidates.”

## Postdoc careers {.smaller}
> Those who stayed and landed a coveted faculty position were more likely to have had a highly cited paper, changed their research topic between their PhD and postdoc, or moved abroad after receiving their doctorate.
